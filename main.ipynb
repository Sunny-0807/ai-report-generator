Content is incomplete and subject to change.For the latest stable version, see the current [LangGraph Python](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) or [LangGraph JavaScript](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) docs.\\n\\nTrusted by companies shaping the future of agents— including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more— LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.\\nLangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/python/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools).\\nWe will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting start with agents or want a higher level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s [agents](/oss/python/langchain/agents) that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool calling loops.\\nLangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#install) Install\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n```\\npip install --pre -U langgraph\\n\\n```\\n\\nThen, create a simple hello world example:\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END\\n\\ndef mock_llm(state: MessagesState):\\n    return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"ai\", \"content\": \"hello world\"}]}\\n\\ngraph = StateGraph(MessagesState)\\ngraph.add_node(mock_llm)\\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"mock_llm\")\\ngraph.add_edge(\"mock_llm\", END)\\ngraph = graph.compile()\\n\\ngraph.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"hi!\"}]})\\n\\n```\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#core-benefits) Core benefits\\n\\nLangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:\\n\\n* [Durable execution](/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.\\n* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.\\n* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.\\n* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.\\n* [Production-ready deployment](/langsmith/deployments): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#langgraph-ecosystem) LangGraph ecosystem\\n\\nWhile LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:\\n\\n* [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.\\n* [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [Studio](/langsmith/studio).\\n* [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) - Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#acknowledgements) Acknowledgements\\n\\nLangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/).

At its core, LangGraph combines large language models (LLMs) with graph-based architectures allowing developers to map, organize and optimize how AI agents interact and make decisions.\\n\\nBy treating workflows as interconnected nodes and edges, LangGraph offers a scalable, transparent and developer-friendly way to design advanced AI systems ranging from simple chatbots to multi-agent system.\\n\\n## Workflow of LangGraph\\n\\nThe diagram below shows how LangGraph structures its agent-based workflow using distinct tools and stages.\\n\\nHere\\'s a step-by-step interpretation of the flow:\\n\\n1. ****Start:**** The process begins with the agent (Assistant) initiating an interaction or task.\\n2. ****Assistant:**** This is the central node managing the overall workflow. It controls the movement between tools and sequences based on the current state.\\n3. ****Enter Write Sequence:**** If the task requires writing assistance like generating content, the workflow enters a dedicated writing sequence.\\n4. ****Write Assistant:**** This specialized module focuses on the writing process. It may loop with tools for refining or editing before completing the sequence.\\n5. ****Leave Write Sequence:**** Once the writing task is complete the system exits the write mode.\\n6. ****Writer Sensitive Tools & Assistant Tools:**** These nodes provide specialized capabilities. Depending on the state the Assistant routes tasks to tools that enhance writing or perform sensitive operations.\\n7. ****End:**** The process concludes once the desired outcome is achieved and all necessary tools have been executed.\\n\\n## Components of LangGraph\\n\\nThese core components work together smoothly to help developers build, customize and manage complex AI-driven workflows.\\n\\n* ****Monitoring mechanism:**** Human-in-the-loop (HITL) ensures humans remain part of the decision-making process. It improves machine learning accuracy by using critical data points instead of relying on random sampling.\\n* ****Stateful graphs:**** Each node represents a step in computation and carries forward information from previous steps. This enables continuous, contextual processing of data throughout the workflow.\\n* ****Cyclical graphs:**** Graphs that contain loops is used for workflows where certain steps may repeat. It becomes important for complex agent run-times.\\n* ****Nodes:**** The individual components or agents within a workflow is called node. They act like “actors” performing tasks or calling tools (e.g., a ToolNode for tool integration).\\n* ****Edges:**** Edges determine which node should run next. They can follow fixed paths or branching conditions based on the system state.\\n* ****RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**** [RAG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/) enhances LLMs by adding relevant external documents as context, improving the accuracy and richness of outputs.\\n* ****Workflows:**** Sequences of interactions between nodes. By designing workflows, users combine multiple nodes into powerful, dynamic AI processes.\\n* ****APIs:**** A set of tools to programmatically add nodes, modify workflows or extract data. Offers developers flexibility and seamless integration with other systems.\\n* ****LangSmith:**** [LangSmith](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/introduction-to-langsmith/) is a dedicated API for managing large language models (LLMs).

It extends the capabilities of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) while specifically addressing limitations in existing frameworks for agent development. As a specialized tool for creating complex LLM applications, LangGraph provides a structured approach to building sophisticated workflows that require cyclical processing patterns.\\n\\n## **Fundamental Design Principles**\\n\\nLangGraph is built on top of and intended to be used with LangChain, extending the LangChain Expression Language with capabilities to coordinate multiple chains or actors across computational steps in a cyclic manner. The library is inspired by graph processing frameworks like Pregel and Apache Beam, offering an interface similar to NetworkX for building complex agent systems. Unlike purely Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) frameworks, LangGraph’s main distinctive feature is its support for cycles, which are essential for building agent-like behaviors where LLMs need to be called in loops to determine subsequent actions.\\n\\nThe architecture of LangGraph fundamentally revolves around modeling applications as directed graphs. Each node in the graph represents an LLM agent or computational component, while edges represent the communication channels or information flow between these components. This structured approach enables developers to create clear, manageable workflows where components perform specific tasks and pass information to other components as needed, supporting both linear sequences and complex conditional branching.\\n\\n## **State Management**\\n\\nOne of LangGraph’s core strengths is its automatic state management capability, which allows tracking and persistence of information across multiple interactions within an application. As agents perform tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs. This feature is particularly valuable in multi-step agent workflows where context from previous steps influences future decisions, creating a more coherent and continuous experience.\\n\\nThe state management in LangGraph handles the complexity of maintaining conversation history, tool outputs, and intermediate reasoning steps without requiring developers to implement custom state tracking mechanisms. This reduces cognitive load when building complex applications and helps prevent state-related bugs that might otherwise occur in multi-agent systems.\\n\\n## **Setting Up a LangGraph System**\\n\\nCreating a functional LangGraph application begins with installation through pip: pip install langgraph. The implementation process involves defining nodes, establishing connections between them, and specifying the execution flow. Nodes in LangGraph can represent various components such as LLM agents, tool executors, or data processors, each responsible for specific functionality within the overall system.\\n\\nThe Graph class serves as the primary interface for constructing LangGraph applications. Through methods like add\\\\_node, add\\\\_edge, and add\\\\_conditional\\\\_edges, developers can define the structure and behavior of their agent workflows. The set\\\\_entry\\\\_point method designates the starting node for the graph execution, while the compile method transforms the graph definition into a runnable LangChain object.\\n\\n## **Defining Workflow Logic**\\n\\nA typical LangGraph workflow definition includes several key components. First, nodes are added to represent the main actors or processing steps in the application. Then, edges are established to define the flow of information between nodes. Conditional edges allow for dynamic routing based on the output of nodes, enabling adaptive behaviors that can respond appropriately to different situations.\\n\\nFor example, in an agent workflow, one might define an “agent” node that decides what action to take and a “tools” node that executes those actions. A conditional edge from the agent node could either continue to the tools node or exit the workflow based on the agent’s decision, with a regular edge returning from the tools back to the agent to form a cycle. This cyclical structure enables the iterative decision-making characteristic of agent systems.\\n\\n## **Cyclical Workflow Support**\\n\\nThe most significant advantage of LangGraph is its explicit support for cyclical workflows, which are essential for implementing agent-like behaviors. As emphasized in the documentation: “Crucially, this is NOT a DAG framework… Cycles are important for agent-like behaviors, where you call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.” This capability enables the development of sophisticated agents that can iteratively refine their understanding and actions, leading to more capable AI systems.\\n\\nTraditional DAG frameworks struggle with these types of applications because they fundamentally cannot represent the looping patterns needed for agent decision-making. LangGraph bridges this gap, making it substantially easier to implement complex agent behaviors that require multiple rounds of thinking, tool use, and refinement.\\n\\n## **Streamlined Multi-Agent Coordination**\\n\\nLangGraph provides a clear and intuitive mechanism for defining coordination between multiple agents or components in a system. The graph-based structure visually represents how information flows between components, making it easier to design, implement, and reason about complex multi-agent workflows. This explicit coordination model helps prevent common issues in multi-agent systems such as race conditions, deadlocks, or communication failures.\\n\\nThe framework’s state management capabilities further enhance multi-agent coordination by ensuring that all agents have access to the necessary context and can build upon each other’s work. This creates cohesive systems where specialized agents can collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.\\n\\n## **Advanced Streaming Capabilities**\\n\\nLangGraph includes built-in support for streaming output from nodes as they are produced. This streaming capability allows for real-time monitoring of workflow execution, providing visibility into the intermediate states and decisions made by each component. Developers can observe how information flows through the system and how agents respond to different inputs, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding complex agent behaviors.\\n\\n## Get Ken Lin’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nThe streaming functionality can be leveraged for user interfaces that display intermediate results or thought processes, creating more transparent AI systems where users can follow the reasoning path that led to particular conclusions or recommendations.\\n\\n## **Increased Complexity for Simple Applications**\\n\\nFor straightforward applications that don’t require cyclical workflows or multi-agent coordination, LangGraph may introduce unnecessary complexity. The overhead of defining graphs, managing state, and coordinating components might not be justified for simple use cases where a linear chain of operations would suffice. Developers should consider whether their application truly needs the advanced features LangGraph provides or if a simpler approach would be more appropriate.\\n\\nThe additional abstraction layer introduced by the graph-based programming model can make simple logic more difficult to follow compared to procedural code or basic chain structures. This complexity becomes worthwhile in sophisticated applications but could be a disadvantage in more straightforward scenarios.\\n\\n## **Learning Curve and Development Overhead**\\n\\nThe graph-based programming paradigm, while powerful, presents a learning curve for developers new to this approach or to the LangChain ecosystem. Understanding how to effectively structure graphs, manage state, and implement conditional logic within the LangGraph framework requires time and experience. Organizations adopting LangGraph may need to invest in training and documentation to bring their development teams up to speed.\\n\\nAdditionally, the framework’s abstraction can sometimes make debugging more challenging, as issues may arise from the interaction between components rather than within individual components. This distributed nature of problems can increase the effort required to identify and resolve issues in complex graphs.\\n\\n## **Integration Challenges**\\n\\nWhile LangGraph integrates well with the LangChain ecosystem, incorporating it into existing systems or workflows may require significant adaptation. The framework’s assumptions about state management and execution flow might not align perfectly with other frameworks or custom implementations, necessitating additional integration work.\\n\\nFor organizations with established AI infrastructure, adopting LangGraph might involve refactoring existing code or creating adapter layers to bridge between different paradigms. This integration effort should be factored into decisions about whether to adopt LangGraph for specific projects.\\n\\n## **Complex Conversational Agents**\\n\\nLangGraph excels in building sophisticated conversational agents that maintain context, make decisions, and adapt their behavior based on user interactions. The cyclical nature of conversation, where each exchange builds on previous context, aligns perfectly with LangGraph’s support for stateful, iterative workflows. These agents can engage in multi-turn conversations, use tools to gather information, and progressively refine their responses based on user feedback.\\n\\nThe framework’s state management capabilities ensure that conversational context is maintained across interactions, while its conditional logic allows agents to handle diverse user inputs appropriately. This makes LangGraph particularly valuable for building virtual assistants, customer service bots, or educational agents that need to engage in extended, meaningful dialogues.\\n\\n## **Research and Simulation Environments**\\n\\nMulti-agent systems built with LangGraph can be used to simulate complex environments where different actors interact according to specific rules or objectives. These simulations can model economic systems, social dynamics, or competitive scenarios, providing insights into emergent behaviors and complex interactions.\\n\\nThe explicit representation of agent relationships and information flow in LangGraph makes it well-suited for research applications where understanding and visualizing system dynamics is important. Researchers can analyze how different agent configurations and communication patterns affect overall system behavior, leading to insights that might not be apparent from studying individual agents in isolation.\\n\\n## **Decision Support Systems**\\n\\nLangGraph’s support for cyclical workflows makes it ideal for building decision support systems that involve iterative reasoning, information gathering, and analysis. These systems can help professionals in fields like medicine, finance, or law navigate complex decisions by breaking problems down into manageable steps, gathering relevant information through tools, and synthesizing insights from multiple sources.\\n\\nThe framework’s ability to model complex reasoning processes as explicit graphs allows for more transparent decision-making, where users can understand the steps and considerations that led to particular recommendations. This transparency is particularly valuable in high-stakes domains where explainability is a key requirement.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nLangGraph represents a significant advancement in the toolkit available for developing sophisticated LLM applications, particularly those involving agent-like behaviors and multi-agent coordination. By extending LangChain with support for cyclical workflows and robust state management, it addresses key limitations of earlier approaches and enables new possibilities for AI systems that can reason, act, and interact in more complex ways.\\n\\nWhile the framework introduces some complexity and requires investment to master, its benefits for developing advanced AI applications make it a valuable addition to the LangChain ecosystem. As LLM applications continue to grow in sophistication, tools like LangGraph will play an increasingly important role in helping developers create more capable, flexible, and reliable AI systems.\\n\\nFor organizations and developers looking to build complex agent systems or applications requiring stateful, iterative processing, LangGraph provides a robust foundation that can significantly reduce development time and improve system quality. However, those working on simpler applications should carefully evaluate whether the additional complexity is justified by their specific requirements and use cases.\\n\\n[Langgraph](/tag/langgraph?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Llm](/tag/llm?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Llm Applications](/tag/llm-applications?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[AI](/tag/ai?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Pipeline](/tag/pipeline?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[## Written by Ken Lin](/@ken_lin?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[41 followers](/@ken_lin/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n·[23 following](/@ken_lin/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\nI'm Ken, an engineer specializing in AI and machine learning.

2024\\n\\n   9  min read\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field. As a result, language models have advanced to a point where AI agents are able to perform complex tasks and make complex decisions. However, as these agents’ skills have grown, the infrastructure that supports them has found it difficult to keep up. Presenting LangGraph, a revolutionary library that aims to revolutionize AI agent building and runtime execution.\\n\\n#### **Overview**\\n\\n* LangGraph is a library built on top of Langchain that is designed to facilitate the creation of cyclic graphs for large language model (LLM) – based AI agents.\\n* It views agent Objective Points about LangGraph and workflows as cyclic graph topologies, allowing for more variable and nuanced agent behaviors than linear execution models.\\n* LangGraph uses key elements such as nodes (representing functions or Langchain runnable items), edges (defining execution and data flow), and stateful graphs (managing persistent data across execution cycles).\\n* The library supports multi-agent coordination, allowing each agent to have its prompt, LLM, tools, and custom code within a single graph structure.\\n* Langgraph introduces a chat agent executor that represents the agent state as a list of messages, which is particularly useful for newer, chat-based models.\\n\\n## Table of contents\\n\\n* [Introduction](#h-introduction)\\n* [The Pre-LangGraph Era](#h-the-pre-langgraph-era)\\n* [What is LangGraph?](#h-what-is-langgraph)\\n* [Why use LangGraph?](#h-why-use-langgraph)\\n* [How LangGraph Works?](#h-how-langgraph-works)\\n* [Tool Calling in LangGraph](#h-tool-calling-in-langgraph)\\n  + [Pre-requisites](#h-pre-requisites)\\n  + [Define Tools](#h-define-tools)\\n* [Pre-built Agent](#h-pre-built-agent)\\n* [Build an Agent](#h-build-an-agent)\\n* [What LangGraph Offers?](#h-what-langgraph-offers)\\n* [Real-World Example of LangGraph](#h-real-world-example-of-langgraph)\\n* [The Future of AI Agents](#h-the-future-of-ai-agents)\\n* [Conclusion](#h-conclusion)\\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](#h-frequently-asked-questions)\\n\\n## The Pre-LangGraph Era\\n\\nThe agent executor class in the [Langchain framework](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/10/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-chains-in-langchain/) was the main tool for building and executing AI agents before LangGraph. This class relied on a straightforward but powerful idea: it used an agent in a loop, asking it to make decisions, carry them out, and log observations. This technique had its uses, but its adaptability and customization possibilities were intrinsically restricted.\\n\\nAlthough functional, the agent executor class limited developers’ ability to design more dynamic and flexible agent runtimes by imposing a particular pattern of tool calling and error handling. As AI agents became more sophisticated, the need for a more adaptable architecture emerged.\\n\\n## What is LangGraph?\\n\\nIn response to these constraints, LangGraph presents a novel paradigm for agent building and runtime construction. [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/03/an-introduction-to-large-language-models-llms/) are the foundation for designing sophisticated AI agents, and LangGraph, built on top of Langchain, is intended to make the process of creating cyclic graphs easier.\\n\\nLangGraph views agent workflows as cyclic graph topologies at their foundation. This method enables more variable and nuanced behaviors from agents, surpassing its predecessors’ linear execution model. Using graph theory, LangGraph provides new avenues for developing intricate, networked agent systems.\\n\\n## Why use LangGraph?\\n\\n* **Flexibility:** As AI agents evolved, developers required more control over the agent runtime to enable personalized action plans and decision-making procedures.\\n* **The Cyclical Nature of AI Reasoning:** Many intricate LLM applications depend on cyclical execution when employing strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning. LangGraph offers a natural framework for modeling these cyclical processes.\\n* **Multi-Agent Systems:** As multi-agent workflows became more common, there was an increasing demand for a system that could efficiently manage and coordinate several autonomous agents.\\n\\n**State Management:** As agents became more sophisticated, tracking and updating state data as the agent was being executed became necessary. LangGraph’s stateful graph methodology satisfies this need.\\n\\n## How LangGraph Works?\\n\\nThe functionality of LangGraph is based on several essential elements:\\n\\n* **Nodes:** These are functions or [Langchain](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/10/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-chains-in-langchain/) runnable items, like the agent’s tools.\\n* **Edges:** Paths that define the direction of execution and data flow within the agent system, connecting nodes.\\n* **Stateful Graphs:** LangGraph allows for persistent data across execution cycles by managing and updating state objects as data flows through the nodes.\\n\\nThe following diagram can be used to illustrate the working:\\n\\nAs shown in the image, the nodes include LLM, tools, etc. which are represented by circles or rhombus which. Flow of information between various nodes is represented by arrows.\\n\\nThe popular [NetworkX library](https://networkx.org/) served as the model for the library’s interface, which makes it user-friendly for developers with prior experience with graph-based programming.\\n\\nLangGraph’s approach to agent runtime differs significantly from that of its forerunners. Instead of a basic loop, it enables the construction of intricate, networked systems of nodes and edges. With this structure, developers can design more complex decision-making procedures and action sequences.\\n\\nNow, let us build an agent using LangGraph to understand them better. First, we will implement tool calling, then using a pre-built agent, and then building an agent ourselves in LangGraph.\\n\\n## Tool Calling in LangGraph\\n\\n### Pre-requisites\\n\\nCreate an OpenAI API key to access the LLMs and Weather API key ([get here](https://www.weatherapi.com/)) to access the weather information. Store these keys in a ‘.env’ file:\\n\\n**Load and Import the keys as follows**:\\n\\n```\\nimport os from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv(\\'/.env\\') WEATHER_API_KEY = os.environ[\\'WEATHER_API_KEY\\']\\xa0 # Import the required libraries and methods import json import requests import rich from typing import List, Literal from IPython.display import Image, display from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults from langchain_core.tools import tool from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n```\\n\\n### Define Tools\\n\\nWe will define two tools. One is to to get weather information when the query is specific to weather and another is to search the internet when the LLM doesn’t know the answer to the given query:\\n\\n```\\n@tool def get_weather(query: str) -> list: \"\"\"Search weatherapi to get the current weather.\"\"\" base_url = \"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json\" complete_url = f\"{base_url}?key={WEATHER_API_KEY}&q={query}\" response = requests.get(complete_url) data = response.json() if data.get(\"location\"): \\xa0 \\xa0 return data else: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 return \"Weather Data Not Found\" @tool def search_web(query: str) -> list: \"\"\"Search the web for a query.\"\"\" tavily_search = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2, search_depth=\\'advanced\\', max_tokens=1000) results = tavily_search.invoke(query) return results\\n```\\n\\nTo make these tools available for the LLM, we can bind these tools to the LLM as follows:\\n\\n```\\ngpt = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0) tools = [search_web, get_weather] gpt_with_tools = gpt.bind_tools(tools)\\n```\\n\\nNow, let’s invoke the LLM to with a prompt to see the results:\\n\\n```\\nprompt = \"\"\" \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Given only the tools at your disposal, mention tool calls for the following tasks: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do not change the query given for any search tasks \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1. What is the current weather in Greenland today \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2. Can you tell me about Greenland and its capital \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 3. Why is the sky blue? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"\"\" results = gpt_with_tools.invoke(prompt) results.tool_calls\\n```\\n\\n**The results will be the following:**\\n\\nAs we see, when we ask about the weather, get\\\\_weather tool is called.\\n\\nThe GPT model doesn’t know the who won ICC worldcup in 2024, as it is updated with information upto October 2023 only. So, when we ask about this query, it is calling search\\\\_web tool.\\n\\n## Pre-built Agent\\n\\nLangGraph has pre-built react (reason and act) agent. Let’s see how it works:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent # system prompt is used to inform the tools available to when to use each system_prompt = \"\"\"Act as a helpful assistant. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use the tools at your disposal to perform tasks as needed. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - get_weather: whenever user asks get the weather of a place. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - search_web: whenever user asks for information on current events or if you don\\'t know the answer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use the tools only if you don\\'t know the answer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"\"\" # we can initialize the agent using the gpt model, tools, and system prompt. agent = create_react_agent(model=gpt, tools=tools, state_modifier=system_prompt) # We will discuss its working in the next section. Let’s query the agent to see the result. def print_stream(stream): for s in stream: \\xa0\\xa0 message = s[\"messages\"][-1] \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 if isinstance(message, tuple): \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 print(message) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 else: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 message.pretty_print() inputs = {\"messages\": [(\"user\", \"who won the ICC worldcup in 2024?\")]} print_stream(agent.stream(inputs, stream_mode=\"values\"))\\n```\\n\\nAs we can see from the output, the LLM called the search\\\\_web tool for the given query, and tool found a URL and returned content back to the LLM which contains result to the query. Then, LLM returned the answer.\\n\\n## Build an Agent\\n\\nNow we build an agent using langGraph:\\n\\n```\\n# import the required methods from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END # define a tool_node with the available tools tools = [search_web, get_weather] tool_node = ToolNode(tools) # define functions to call the LLM or the tools def call_model(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] response = gpt_with_tools.invoke(messages) return {\"messages\": [response]} def call_tools(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"tools\", END]: messages = state[\"messages\"] last_message = messages[-1] if last_message.tool_calls: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 return \"tools\" return END\\n```\\n\\nThe call\\\\_model function takes “messages” from state as input. The “messages” can include query, prompt, or content form the tools. It returns the response.\\n\\nThe call\\\\_tools function also takes state messages as input. If the last message contains tool calls, as we have seen in tool\\\\_calling output, then it returns “tools” node. Otherwise it ends.\\n\\nNow let’s build nodes and edges:\\n\\n```\\n# initialize the workflow from StateGraph workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState) # add a node named ‘LLM’, with call_model function. This node uses an LLM to make decisions based on the input given workflow.add_node(\"LLM\", call_model) # Our workflow starts with the ‘LLM’ node workflow.add_edge(START, \"LLM\") # Add a ‘tools’ node workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node) # depending on the output of the LLM, it can go ‘tools’ node or end. So, we add a conditional edge from LLM to call_tools function workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"LLM\", call_tools) # ‘tools’ node sends the information back to the LLM workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"LLM\")\\n```\\n\\nNow let’s compile the workflow and display it.\\n\\n```\\nagent = workflow.compile() display(Image(agent.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n```\\n\\nAs shown in the image, we start with the LLM. The LLM either calls the tools or ends based on the available information to it. If it calls any tool, the tool executes and send the result back to the LLM. And the LLM again decides to call the tool or end.\\n\\nNow let’s query the agent and see the result:\\n\\n```\\nfor chunk in agent.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"user\", \"Will it rain in Bengaluru today?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\",): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n```\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\nAs we have asked about the weather, get\\\\_weather tool is called and it returned various weather related values. Based on those values, the LLM returned that it is unlikely to rain.\\n\\nIn this way, we can add different kinds of tools to the LLM so that we can get our queries answered even if LLM alone can’t answer. Thus LLM agents will be far more useful in many scanarios.\\n\\n## What LangGraph Offers?\\n\\nLangGraph offers a powerful toolset for building complex AI systems. It provides a framework for creating [agentic systems](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/building-agentic-rag-systems-with-langgraph/) that can reason, make decisions, and interact with multiple data sources. Key features include:\\n\\n* **Modifiable Agent Runtimes:** With LangGraph, developers may create runtimes specifically suited to particular use cases and agent behaviors, overcoming the limitations of the conventional agent executor.\\n* **Support for Cyclic Execution:** When cyclic graphs are enabled, LangGraph makes applying sophisticated reasoning methods that require several LLM iterations easier.\\n* **Improved State Management:** Because LangGraph graphs are stateful, more intricate agent state tracking and updating can be done throughout the execution phase.\\n* **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Within a single graph structure, each agent can have its prompt, LLM, tools, and custom code. LangGraph is an expert in building and administering these kinds of systems.\\n* **Flexible Tool Integration:** LangGraph’s node-based structure allows agents to easily incorporate various tools and functionalities into their repertoire.\\n* **Better Control Flow:** LangGraph’s edge-based approach provides fine-grained control over the execution flow of an agent or multi-agent system.\\n* **Chat-Based Agent Support:** LangGraph introduces a chat agent executor, representing the agent state as a list of messages. This is particularly useful for newer chat-based models that handle function calling as part of message parameters.\\n\\n## Real-World Example of LangGraph\\n\\nLangGraph has many different real-world applications. It makes more complex decision-making processes possible in single-agent contexts by letting actors review and improve their arguments before acting. This is especially helpful in difficult problem-solving situations where linear execution might not be sufficient.\\n\\nLangGraph excels in multi-agent systems. It permits the development of complicated agent ecosystems, wherein many specialized agents can work together to accomplish intricate tasks. LangGraph controls each agent’s interactions and information sharing through its graph structure, which can be developed with specific capabilities.\\n\\nFor instance, a system with distinct agents for comprehending the initial query, retrieving knowledge, generating responses, and ensuring quality assurance may be developed in a customer service setting. LangGraph would oversee information flow management, enabling smooth and efficient consumer engagement among these workers.\\n\\n## The Future of AI Agents\\n\\nFrameworks such as LangGraph are becoming increasingly important as AI develops.

It may be difficult to coordinate these agents, keep context across steps and achieve reliable results. LangGraph is a tool for solving this challenge. It is a framework on LangChain ecosystem that gives a way to define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents in complex workflows. In other words, for anyone wondering what is LangGraph, it is a stateful orchestration framework for AI agents that gives developers more control over how those agents interact and solve problems.\\n\\nLangChain launched LangGraph in 2023 as an addition to its toolkit, and it has rapidly become popular among AI developers. In June 2024, LangGraph achieved a stable release and almost 50 percent of the organizations that used LangChain LangSmith observability tool were using LangGraph in their applications. In this article, I will decompose the main ideas of LangGraph, discuss its applications with examples, and tell you how to start working with this powerful framework.\\n\\n## **LangGraph at a Glance**\\n\\nLangGraph is an open-source library from the LangChain team and free to use. It can be used in [Python](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-python-programming/ \"Python\") as well as JavaScript environments, which means that it can be used by a large number of developers. In contrast to more basic chain-based systems, LangGraph is a graph-based system that coordinates AI workflows. This means that instead of a linear sequence of steps, an application is modeled as a directed graph of nodes and edges.\\n\\nThe graph is composed of nodes (representing a unit of work, e.g. an LLM call or a tool invocation) and edges that characterize the flow of information and control between the units. LangGraph allows more complex, multi-agent interactions and decision-making processes than linear pipelines by modelling workflows as graphs (with the option of loops or cyclical flows). State management is automatically done by the framework across the graph and all agents get the context they require as the workflow continues. To put it briefly, LangGraph is about coordinating various AI elements to operate in coordination, have memory of previous interactions, and enable complex control flows within an application.\\n\\n**Is LangGraph free and open source?** Yes. [LangGraph is released under the MIT open-source license and is free to use for any project](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph#:~:text=Is%20LangGraph%20open%20source%3F%20Is,it%20free). The core LangGraph library can be self-hosted and integrated into your own infrastructure without cost. For production deployments, the LangChain team also offers *LangGraph Platform* as a managed service (with additional features like a hosted server, developer studio, and scaling options), but using the LangGraph open-source framework itself does not require any subscription. This makes LangGraph an attractive option for developers and companies who want full control over their AI agent workflows without vendor lock-in.\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| **`FURTHER READING:`** |\\n| `1. 15 Best Mobile App Development Platforms to Review in 2025` |\\n| `2. 10 Mobile App Development Tips You Need to Know` |\\n| `3. Top 10 Mobile App Development Software in 2025: A Review` |\\n\\n## **Key Concepts of LangGraph**\\n\\nLangGraph proposes some main concepts that make it different to the simpler orchestration tools. These concepts are important to understand what does LangGraph do internally and how does it make advanced AI applications possible. The fundamental ideas are graph structure, state management, and agent coordination, and additional features (persistent and human interaction). These concepts are summarized below:\\n\\n### **Graph Structure**\\n\\nLangGraph represents an AI application as a directed graph. The graph nodes are discrete units of work or computation, usually Python functions that do something like call an LLM, query a database, call a tool or API, or implement business logic. Edges are the links between nodes which define the flow of execution. An edge may be a straight path or a conditional branch that sends the workflow in one direction or another depending on the result of a node (like an if-else decision).\\n\\nThis graph-based method introduces clarity and modularity: each node performs a certain sub-task, and the edges determine the way the system moves between steps. LangGraph allows cycles (loops) in the graph, and thus supports iterative processes, where an agent may repeat steps as required, which is not easy to achieve in a strictly linear chain-based system. This graph structure therefore forms the skeleton of the construction of complex and non-linear workflows.\\n\\n### **State Management**\\n\\nIn multi-step AI processes, it is essential to be able to track information (memory) between steps. LangGraph has automatic state management to preserve and pass context across the graph. The state is a common object (such as a dictionary or Pydantic model) that nodes may read and write to during the execution of the program.\\n\\nAn example is in a [chatbot](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-a-chatbot-and-how-does-it-work/ \"chatbot\") application whose state could be used to save the history of the conversation so that the AI could remember what was said previously. The state may contain intermediate results or user preferences in a data analysis agent. LangGraph keeps this state dynamic as agents go about their work. Since the state is centrally managed, any agent (node) can always access the most up-to-date context that it requires to perform its task. This aspect takes the pressure off the developers to explicitly pass context around or deal with global variables. Rather, LangGraph provides consistency and continuity of data which is vital in ensuring coherence in complex conversations or multi-step calculations. One of the most impressive features of LangGraph is automatic state management which makes development easier and error-free by managing the context behind the scenes.\\n\\n### **Agent Coordination and Control Flow**\\n\\nLangGraph is simply about the coordination of multiple agents (or chain components) to work towards a goal. It makes sure that the agents act in the right sequence, under the appropriate conditions and with the required information shared among them.\\n\\nThis coordination implies that you can have specialized agents, e.g. one agent to plan a task, another agent to retrieve information, another agent to produce a final answer, all within one coordinated system. LangGraph allows such advanced control flow constructs as loops (cycles) and conditional branches, allowing agents to make decisions and even re-attempt or re-edit steps when necessary. LangGraph enables high-level logic development by developers without concern over low-level scheduling of agent actions by controlling the flow of execution. It is in a sense the project manager of your AI agents, ensuring that each piece of the workflow occurs when it should and there is relay of the correct data to the next step. This results in more deterministic and debuggable behavior than allowing an LLM agent to run in a runaway loop. The outcome is sound, organized orchestration of AI work.\\n\\n### **Multi-Agent Support**\\n\\nLangGraph is particularly suitable to support multi-agent systems due to its graph design and statefulness. In a multi-agent system, various AI agents perform different subtasks (e.g. one agent may be specialized in knowledge retrieval whereas another agent is specialized in reasoning or decision-making). LangGraph gives the support structure to these agents to communicate and collaborate. The agents may be modeled as nodes, and the graph edges and shared state determine their interactions.\\n\\nSuch a modular design has advantages such as specialization (each agent can be configured or triggered to perform its particular task) and simplified troubleshooting (you can identify which node/agent may be causing a problem). LangGraph can help create multi-agent workflows to address complex problems in which the work is broken down and then the results are combined by the orchestrator. As an example, a multi-agent research assistant could be designed with one agent retrieving relevant documents, another agent processing the content to find answers, and a third agent generating a coherent report, all running in a single LangGraph workflow.\\n\\n### **Persistence and Debugging**\\n\\nLangGraph has a persistence layer through checkpointers that is able to save the state of the graph at different points. This makes possible such powerful features as time travel (replaying or exploring alternative execution paths) and fault tolerance (resuming at a checkpoint in case something goes wrong). Further, LangGraph allows breakpoints to halt execution, and even a human-in-the-loop, where a human can step in at specific steps.\\n\\nThese properties are essential to debugging complex agent behavior, and to applications where human confirmation is required (e.g. an AI agent may wait until a human confirms an answer before continuing). Another feature is streaming support- LangGraph supports streaming token-by-token outputs of LLMs to offer real-time feedback within user interfaces. All these complex features render LangGraph as production ready where robustness and user experience are priorities. They also point out the attention that the framework pays to providing the developers with visibility and control over the thought process of the agent, rather than treating the agent as a black box.\\n\\nTo conclude, the main ideas of LangGraph are based on the management of complexity with the help of a graph model. Graph structures provide flexibility in workflow design; state management makes sure that context is maintained; coordination and control flow tools enable complex logic and multi-agent systems; and built-in capabilities such as persistence, streaming, and human-in-loop support make it feasible in real-world, error-tolerant systems. It is this set of features that has led to LangGraph being referred to as adding a degree of control to agent workflows over previous agent frameworks.\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| **`FURTHER READING:`** |\\n| `1. 10 Web Application Examples and Definition for Beginners` |\\n| `2. Web Application Development Tutorial: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners` |\\n| `3. Web Application Security: The Best Guide and Its Practices` |\\n\\n## **Common Use Cases of LangGraph**\\n\\nLangGraph is a general framework, but it truly shines in scenarios where simple linear chains are not enough. Here are some concrete examples and use cases of LangGraph in action:\\n\\n### **Advanced Customer Service Chatbots**\\n\\nLangGraph is used by companies to create smart customer support chatbots that are not limited to Q&A. As an example, a chatbot with LangGraph can remember previous orders or preferences of a user stored in the shared state and utilize that information to personalize a response. It can deal with multi-step requests (such as checking an order status, followed by making a return), and can even escalate to a human agent when required at a breakpoint. This enhances customer service by delivering faster, context-sensitive responses and human-in-the-loop handoff to handle more complex problems.\\n\\n### **Research Assistant Agents**\\n\\nLangGraph is able to organize agents as a research assistant to analysts or students. One agent may search the scholarly articles or data sources, another one may extract and summarize the main points of the sources, and the third agent may create a report or provide answers to the questions. This type of system is able to automatically collect information and bring out key insights on large sets of documents. The graph workflow makes sure that the search and summarize steps occur sequentially and that the summary agent receives all the information it requires. The use case shows that LangGraph can control retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in a systematic manner.\\n\\n### **Personalized Learning Systems**\\n\\nLangGraph can drive tutoring or e-learning assistants that can be customized to the learner in the field of education technology. As an example, an intelligent tutor may employ one agent to evaluate the performance of a student on practice questions, and another agent to create new exercises or explanations depending on the weak areas of the student. The state would monitor the progress and preferences of the learner. LangGraph enables such a system to adapt the content dynamically- in effect a customized curriculum planner and tutor in one. The advantage is a personalized learning process in which the AI keeps track of what the student has not grasped and returns to review the same.\\n\\n### **Business Process Automation**\\n\\nCompanies are using LangGraph to automate and simplify their internal processes. As an example, take an agent that would review incoming documents (forms, invoices, etc) to approve them: one node would use an LLM to extract key information about the document, another would check it against a database, and a final agent would make the decision to approve or flag the document to be reviewed by a human. In the same way, project management activities or data analysis can be shared among several agents (one gathers data, another interprets it, another makes a report). With LangGraph, these processes are turned into automated pipelines capable of accommodating decision points and exceptions.\\n\\nAn example is a LangGraph workflow that automates a multi-step process of generating a report that once involved a number of human handoffs. The outcome is enhanced productivity and minimization of human error because the routine tasks are taken care of by the coordinated agents.\\n\\n### **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks**\\n\\nWhenever an AI solution requires *reasoning through a series of steps* (tool use, calculations, intermediate conclusions), LangGraph is a strong fit. Developers have used LangGraph to build systems like coding assistants (where the agent writes code, tests it, debugs, and tries again in a loop), data pipelines that require cleaning data then applying multiple AI models in sequence, or decision-support systems that weigh different factors via separate agents. The graph approach handles these branching or looping workflows gracefully, whereas a simple chain might fail if a step needs to be revisited or if parallel paths need to converge.\\n\\nThese examples illustrate that LangGraph’s use cases typically involve interactive and intelligent AI agents working in concert. From customer support to research, education, and enterprise automation, LangGraph enables AI solutions that are context-aware, can handle multiple subtasks, and can incorporate logic beyond a single prompt-response. Notably, the rise of such agentic workflows is reflected in industry trends – by late 2024, [43% of organizations using LangSmith (LangChain’s monitoring suite) were sending LangGraph traces](https://blog.langchain.com/langchain-state-of-ai-2024/#:~:text=As%20companies%20are%20getting%20more,go%20beyond%20basic%20LLM%20interactions), indicating a significant uptick in complex multi-step AI applications. This suggests that teams across various domains find value in LangGraph to build more reliable and controllable AI systems than what was possible with earlier one-shot or single-agent approaches.\\n\\n## **Getting Started with LangGraph**\\n\\nNow that we have covered *what LangGraph is* and why it’s useful, let’s look at **how to get started** with LangGraph. Despite enabling complex functionality, LangGraph is designed to be developer-friendly. Here are the basic steps to start building with LangGraph:\\n\\n### **1. Installation**\\n\\nYou can install LangGraph via pip, as it is available on PyPI. Run the following command in your Python environment to get the latest version:\\n\\n*pip install -U langgraph*\\n\\nThis will install the LangGraph library (and its LangChain dependencies if not already present). LangGraph has both Python and JavaScript SDKs, so if you are working in a [Node.js](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-node-js/ \"Node.js\") environment, you can install the JavaScript package via npm or yarn as well.\\n\\n### **2. Define the Graph and State**\\n\\nThe core of a LangGraph application is the **StateGraph**. You start by defining what the *state* will contain. For example, if building a chatbot, your state might include a list of messages. In Python, you can define a TypedDict or dataclass for the state. Then you create a StateGraph object using that state structure. This sets up an empty graph where each future node will automatically have access to an instance of that state. For instance:\\n\\n*from langgraph.graph import StateGraph*\\n\\n*class State(TypedDict):*\\n\\n*messages: list\\xa0 # to store conversation history*\\n\\n*graph = StateGraph(State)*\\n\\nHere, we’ve defined a state with a single field messages which will hold a conversation log. The StateGraph(State) creates a new graph that knows this is the shape of its state.\\n\\n### **3. Add Nodes (Agents) to the Graph**\\n\\nNext, you’ll add **nodes** to the graph. Each node is essentially a function (or an object with a run method) that performs a part of the task. You might have a node that calls an LLM, another node that calls a calculation tool, etc. Using our chatbot example, you could have one node that takes the user’s input and sends it to an LLM to get a response. You define a Python function for that behavior, then use graph.add\\\\_node(name, function) to add it to the graph. For example:\\n\\n*def chatbot\\\\_reply(state: State) -> dict:*\\n\\n*user\\\\_message = state[“messages”][-1]\\xa0 # last message from user*\\n\\n*response = llm.call(user\\\\_message) \\xa0 \\xa0 # call an LLM (pseudo-code)*\\n\\n*return {“messages”: [response]} \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 # append LLM response to messages*\\n\\n*graph.add\\\\_node(“reply”, chatbot\\\\_reply)*\\n\\nIn this snippet, “reply” is the node name. The function chatbot\\\\_reply reads the latest user message from state and returns a new message from the LLM. LangGraph will handle merging that return value into the global state (using special helpers like add\\\\_messages to append rather than overwrite, in this case). You can add as many nodes as needed, each encapsulating a piece of your logic.\\n\\n### **4. Connect Nodes with Edges**\\n\\nAfter defining nodes, you specify how they connect. An edge from Node A to Node B means that after A executes, B will execute next. If multiple edges branch out, you can create conditional execution paths (for example, an edge that only triggers if Node A’s result meets some criteria). In a simple flow, you might have a single path. In our chatbot, if we only have one node “reply” that should repeat on each user input, we can set the graph’s entry point and finish point to that node (creating a cycle):\\n\\n*graph.set\\\\_entry\\\\_point(“reply”)*\\n\\n*graph.set\\\\_finish\\\\_point(“reply”)*\\n\\nThis configuration indicates the graph starts at the “reply” node and also ends there, which effectively forms a loop: after finishing, it can start again when new input arrives. For more complex workflows, you would use graph.add\\\\_edge(node1, node2) for explicit transitions. For instance, you could connect a “plan” node to a “search” node to a “summarize” node in a research assistant scenario. The directed edges ensure the LangGraph orchestrator knows the sequence (or branching logic) to follow.\\n\\n### **5. Compile and Run the Graph**\\n\\nOnce nodes and edges are defined, you typically compile the graph into a runnable form. In LangGraph, calling compiled\\\\_graph = graph.compile() will prepare the graph (check for any issues, lock in the structure). You can then execute it by passing an initial state and letting it run. Using the chatbot example, you might run it in a loop:\\n\\n*compiled\\\\_graph = graph.compile()*\\n\\n*while True:*\\n\\n*user\\\\_input = input(“User: “)*\\n\\n*if user\\\\_input in [“quit”, “exit”]:*\\n\\n*break*\\n\\n*# Start the graph with the new user message added to state*\\n\\n*initial\\\\_state = {“messages”: [(“user”, user\\\\_input)]}*\\n\\n*for event in compiled\\\\_graph.stream(initial\\\\_state):*\\n\\n*# stream yields events as the LLM generates tokens*\\n\\n*pass*\\n\\n*# After streaming, the state will have the assistant’s answer appended*\\n\\n*answer = compiled\\\\_graph.state[“messages”][-1][1]\\xa0 # assuming tuple (speaker, text)*\\n\\n*print(“Assistant:”, answer)*\\n\\nThe above pseudocode outlines how you might continuously take user input and feed it to the LangGraph for processing. The stream() function is used to get token-by-token output (so that the assistant’s answer can be displayed incrementally). After the graph finishes a cycle, the latest assistant message is retrieved from the state for display. This loop would continue until the user decides to quit.\\n\\nFor non-interactive workflows, you might simply call result = compiled\\\\_graph.run(initial\\\\_state) to get a final output after the sequence of nodes executes. The LangGraph documentation and tutorials provide examples of both synchronous execution and streaming.\\n\\n### **6. Leverage Advanced Features**\\n\\nAs you become comfortable, you can utilize LangGraph’s advanced capabilities. For example, you can insert breakpoints or conditional logic that halts the agent and awaits human confirmation (useful in high-stakes applications like medical or financial domains). You can also persist the state to a database at checkpoints so that long-running processes can resume after interruptions. [LangGraph Studio, an IDE announced in 2024](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-studio-the-first-agent-ide/#:~:text=LangGraph%20Studio%20facilitates%20this%20by,at%20that%20point%20in%20time), allows you to visually debug and monitor your graph’s execution on your local machine. These tools can greatly enhance the development experience for complex graphs, but they build on the same fundamentals described above.\\n\\n### **7. Resources and Tutorials**\\n\\nGetting started with LangGraph is best done with guided examples. The official LangChain documentation provides a Quick Start guide and conceptual docs. There are also community tutorials available. For instance, DataCamp offers a *LangGraph tutorial* that walks through building a simple chatbot step by step. Analytics Vidhya has a free LangGraph tutorial for beginners that includes hands-on examples like a support chatbot with tools and memory. (Note: Some people refer to it as a *Langraph tutorial* without the capital “G”, but it’s the same LangGraph framework.) These learning resources illustrate LangGraph examples in code, helping new users quickly pick up the concepts. By following a tutorial and experimenting with a small project, you can gain a practical understanding of LangGraph’s workflow approach in a few hours.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nThis guide explained what is langgraph and why teams use it for agentic workflows.

At its core, LangGraph combines large language models (LLMs) with graph-based architectures allowing developers to map, organize and optimize how AI agents interact and make decisions.\\n\\nBy treating workflows as interconnected nodes and edges, LangGraph offers a scalable, transparent and developer-friendly way to design advanced AI systems ranging from simple chatbots to multi-agent system.\\n\\n## Workflow of LangGraph\\n\\nThe diagram below shows how LangGraph structures its agent-based workflow using distinct tools and stages.\\n\\nHere\\'s a step-by-step interpretation of the flow:\\n\\n1. ****Start:**** The process begins with the agent (Assistant) initiating an interaction or task.\\n2. ****Assistant:**** This is the central node managing the overall workflow. It controls the movement between tools and sequences based on the current state.\\n3. ****Enter Write Sequence:**** If the task requires writing assistance like generating content, the workflow enters a dedicated writing sequence.\\n4. ****Write Assistant:**** This specialized module focuses on the writing process. It may loop with tools for refining or editing before completing the sequence.\\n5. ****Leave Write Sequence:**** Once the writing task is complete the system exits the write mode.\\n6. ****Writer Sensitive Tools & Assistant Tools:**** These nodes provide specialized capabilities. Depending on the state the Assistant routes tasks to tools that enhance writing or perform sensitive operations.\\n7. ****End:**** The process concludes once the desired outcome is achieved and all necessary tools have been executed.\\n\\n## Components of LangGraph\\n\\nThese core components work together smoothly to help developers build, customize and manage complex AI-driven workflows.\\n\\n* ****Monitoring mechanism:**** Human-in-the-loop (HITL) ensures humans remain part of the decision-making process. It improves machine learning accuracy by using critical data points instead of relying on random sampling.\\n* ****Stateful graphs:**** Each node represents a step in computation and carries forward information from previous steps. This enables continuous, contextual processing of data throughout the workflow.\\n* ****Cyclical graphs:**** Graphs that contain loops is used for workflows where certain steps may repeat. It becomes important for complex agent run-times.\\n* ****Nodes:**** The individual components or agents within a workflow is called node. They act like “actors” performing tasks or calling tools (e.g., a ToolNode for tool integration).\\n* ****Edges:**** Edges determine which node should run next. They can follow fixed paths or branching conditions based on the system state.\\n* ****RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**** [RAG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/) enhances LLMs by adding relevant external documents as context, improving the accuracy and richness of outputs.\\n* ****Workflows:**** Sequences of interactions between nodes. By designing workflows, users combine multiple nodes into powerful, dynamic AI processes.\\n* ****APIs:**** A set of tools to programmatically add nodes, modify workflows or extract data. Offers developers flexibility and seamless integration with other systems.\\n* ****LangSmith:**** [LangSmith](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/introduction-to-langsmith/) is a dedicated API for managing large language models (LLMs).

How can I help you today?\"\\n    elif classification == \"search\":\\n        response = ask_gemini(question)\\n    else:\\n        response = \"I\\'m not sure how to respond to that.\"\\n\\n    return {\\n        **state,\\n        \"response\": response\\n    }\\n\\n````\\n\\n### Step 6: Build LangGraph Workflow\\n\\nNow we will:\\n\\n* Import tools for network graph creation and visualization.\\n* Build the workflow graph using LangGraph, adding nodes for classification and response, connecting them with edges and compiling the app.\\n* Include a function to visually display the workflow using networkx and matplotlib, aiding understanding and troubleshooting.\\n\\nPython\\n\\n````\\nimport networkx as nx\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(GraphState)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"classify\", classify)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"respond\", respond)\\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"classify\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"classify\", \"respond\")\\nbuilder.set_finish_point(\"respond\")\\napp = builder.compile()\\n\\n\\ndef visualize_workflow(builder):\\n    G = nx.DiGraph()\\n\\n    for node in builder.nodes:\\n        G.add_node(node)\\n    for edge in builder.edges:\\n        G.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])\\n\\n    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)\\n    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=3000,\\n            node_color=\"skyblue\", font_size=12, font_weight=\"bold\", arrows=True)\\n\\n    plt.title(\"Langchain Workflow Visualization\")\\n    plt.show()\\n\\n\\nvisualize_workflow(builder)\\n\\n````\\n\\n****Output****:\\n\\n### Step 7: Interactive Chat Interface\\n\\nNow we,\\n\\n* Create a command-line chatbot that processes user inputs until “exit” or “quit” is typed.\\n* Send each input through the workflow graph and returns the bot’s response, either a greeting or an AI-powered answer.\\n\\nPython\\n\\n````\\nprint(\"=== Gemini-Powered Chatbot ===\")\\nprint(\"Type your question below.

It extends the capabilities of LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) while specifically addressing limitations in existing frameworks for agent development. As a specialized tool for creating complex LLM applications, LangGraph provides a structured approach to building sophisticated workflows that require cyclical processing patterns.\\n\\n## **Fundamental Design Principles**\\n\\nLangGraph is built on top of and intended to be used with LangChain, extending the LangChain Expression Language with capabilities to coordinate multiple chains or actors across computational steps in a cyclic manner. The library is inspired by graph processing frameworks like Pregel and Apache Beam, offering an interface similar to NetworkX for building complex agent systems. Unlike purely Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) frameworks, LangGraph’s main distinctive feature is its support for cycles, which are essential for building agent-like behaviors where LLMs need to be called in loops to determine subsequent actions.\\n\\nThe architecture of LangGraph fundamentally revolves around modeling applications as directed graphs. Each node in the graph represents an LLM agent or computational component, while edges represent the communication channels or information flow between these components. This structured approach enables developers to create clear, manageable workflows where components perform specific tasks and pass information to other components as needed, supporting both linear sequences and complex conditional branching.\\n\\n## **State Management**\\n\\nOne of LangGraph’s core strengths is its automatic state management capability, which allows tracking and persistence of information across multiple interactions within an application. As agents perform tasks, the state is dynamically updated, ensuring the system maintains context and responds appropriately to new inputs. This feature is particularly valuable in multi-step agent workflows where context from previous steps influences future decisions, creating a more coherent and continuous experience.\\n\\nThe state management in LangGraph handles the complexity of maintaining conversation history, tool outputs, and intermediate reasoning steps without requiring developers to implement custom state tracking mechanisms. This reduces cognitive load when building complex applications and helps prevent state-related bugs that might otherwise occur in multi-agent systems.\\n\\n## **Setting Up a LangGraph System**\\n\\nCreating a functional LangGraph application begins with installation through pip: pip install langgraph. The implementation process involves defining nodes, establishing connections between them, and specifying the execution flow. Nodes in LangGraph can represent various components such as LLM agents, tool executors, or data processors, each responsible for specific functionality within the overall system.\\n\\nThe Graph class serves as the primary interface for constructing LangGraph applications. Through methods like add\\\\_node, add\\\\_edge, and add\\\\_conditional\\\\_edges, developers can define the structure and behavior of their agent workflows. The set\\\\_entry\\\\_point method designates the starting node for the graph execution, while the compile method transforms the graph definition into a runnable LangChain object.\\n\\n## **Defining Workflow Logic**\\n\\nA typical LangGraph workflow definition includes several key components. First, nodes are added to represent the main actors or processing steps in the application. Then, edges are established to define the flow of information between nodes. Conditional edges allow for dynamic routing based on the output of nodes, enabling adaptive behaviors that can respond appropriately to different situations.\\n\\nFor example, in an agent workflow, one might define an “agent” node that decides what action to take and a “tools” node that executes those actions. A conditional edge from the agent node could either continue to the tools node or exit the workflow based on the agent’s decision, with a regular edge returning from the tools back to the agent to form a cycle. This cyclical structure enables the iterative decision-making characteristic of agent systems.\\n\\n## **Cyclical Workflow Support**\\n\\nThe most significant advantage of LangGraph is its explicit support for cyclical workflows, which are essential for implementing agent-like behaviors. As emphasized in the documentation: “Crucially, this is NOT a DAG framework… Cycles are important for agent-like behaviors, where you call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.” This capability enables the development of sophisticated agents that can iteratively refine their understanding and actions, leading to more capable AI systems.\\n\\nTraditional DAG frameworks struggle with these types of applications because they fundamentally cannot represent the looping patterns needed for agent decision-making. LangGraph bridges this gap, making it substantially easier to implement complex agent behaviors that require multiple rounds of thinking, tool use, and refinement.\\n\\n## **Streamlined Multi-Agent Coordination**\\n\\nLangGraph provides a clear and intuitive mechanism for defining coordination between multiple agents or components in a system. The graph-based structure visually represents how information flows between components, making it easier to design, implement, and reason about complex multi-agent workflows. This explicit coordination model helps prevent common issues in multi-agent systems such as race conditions, deadlocks, or communication failures.\\n\\nThe framework’s state management capabilities further enhance multi-agent coordination by ensuring that all agents have access to the necessary context and can build upon each other’s work. This creates cohesive systems where specialized agents can collaborate effectively to solve complex problems.\\n\\n## **Advanced Streaming Capabilities**\\n\\nLangGraph includes built-in support for streaming output from nodes as they are produced. This streaming capability allows for real-time monitoring of workflow execution, providing visibility into the intermediate states and decisions made by each component. Developers can observe how information flows through the system and how agents respond to different inputs, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding complex agent behaviors.\\n\\n## Get Ken Lin’s stories in\\xa0your\\xa0inbox\\n\\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\\xa0this\\xa0writer.\\n\\nThe streaming functionality can be leveraged for user interfaces that display intermediate results or thought processes, creating more transparent AI systems where users can follow the reasoning path that led to particular conclusions or recommendations.\\n\\n## **Increased Complexity for Simple Applications**\\n\\nFor straightforward applications that don’t require cyclical workflows or multi-agent coordination, LangGraph may introduce unnecessary complexity. The overhead of defining graphs, managing state, and coordinating components might not be justified for simple use cases where a linear chain of operations would suffice. Developers should consider whether their application truly needs the advanced features LangGraph provides or if a simpler approach would be more appropriate.\\n\\nThe additional abstraction layer introduced by the graph-based programming model can make simple logic more difficult to follow compared to procedural code or basic chain structures. This complexity becomes worthwhile in sophisticated applications but could be a disadvantage in more straightforward scenarios.\\n\\n## **Learning Curve and Development Overhead**\\n\\nThe graph-based programming paradigm, while powerful, presents a learning curve for developers new to this approach or to the LangChain ecosystem. Understanding how to effectively structure graphs, manage state, and implement conditional logic within the LangGraph framework requires time and experience. Organizations adopting LangGraph may need to invest in training and documentation to bring their development teams up to speed.\\n\\nAdditionally, the framework’s abstraction can sometimes make debugging more challenging, as issues may arise from the interaction between components rather than within individual components. This distributed nature of problems can increase the effort required to identify and resolve issues in complex graphs.\\n\\n## **Integration Challenges**\\n\\nWhile LangGraph integrates well with the LangChain ecosystem, incorporating it into existing systems or workflows may require significant adaptation. The framework’s assumptions about state management and execution flow might not align perfectly with other frameworks or custom implementations, necessitating additional integration work.\\n\\nFor organizations with established AI infrastructure, adopting LangGraph might involve refactoring existing code or creating adapter layers to bridge between different paradigms. This integration effort should be factored into decisions about whether to adopt LangGraph for specific projects.\\n\\n## **Complex Conversational Agents**\\n\\nLangGraph excels in building sophisticated conversational agents that maintain context, make decisions, and adapt their behavior based on user interactions. The cyclical nature of conversation, where each exchange builds on previous context, aligns perfectly with LangGraph’s support for stateful, iterative workflows. These agents can engage in multi-turn conversations, use tools to gather information, and progressively refine their responses based on user feedback.\\n\\nThe framework’s state management capabilities ensure that conversational context is maintained across interactions, while its conditional logic allows agents to handle diverse user inputs appropriately. This makes LangGraph particularly valuable for building virtual assistants, customer service bots, or educational agents that need to engage in extended, meaningful dialogues.\\n\\n## **Research and Simulation Environments**\\n\\nMulti-agent systems built with LangGraph can be used to simulate complex environments where different actors interact according to specific rules or objectives. These simulations can model economic systems, social dynamics, or competitive scenarios, providing insights into emergent behaviors and complex interactions.\\n\\nThe explicit representation of agent relationships and information flow in LangGraph makes it well-suited for research applications where understanding and visualizing system dynamics is important. Researchers can analyze how different agent configurations and communication patterns affect overall system behavior, leading to insights that might not be apparent from studying individual agents in isolation.\\n\\n## **Decision Support Systems**\\n\\nLangGraph’s support for cyclical workflows makes it ideal for building decision support systems that involve iterative reasoning, information gathering, and analysis. These systems can help professionals in fields like medicine, finance, or law navigate complex decisions by breaking problems down into manageable steps, gathering relevant information through tools, and synthesizing insights from multiple sources.\\n\\nThe framework’s ability to model complex reasoning processes as explicit graphs allows for more transparent decision-making, where users can understand the steps and considerations that led to particular recommendations. This transparency is particularly valuable in high-stakes domains where explainability is a key requirement.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nLangGraph represents a significant advancement in the toolkit available for developing sophisticated LLM applications, particularly those involving agent-like behaviors and multi-agent coordination. By extending LangChain with support for cyclical workflows and robust state management, it addresses key limitations of earlier approaches and enables new possibilities for AI systems that can reason, act, and interact in more complex ways.\\n\\nWhile the framework introduces some complexity and requires investment to master, its benefits for developing advanced AI applications make it a valuable addition to the LangChain ecosystem. As LLM applications continue to grow in sophistication, tools like LangGraph will play an increasingly important role in helping developers create more capable, flexible, and reliable AI systems.\\n\\nFor organizations and developers looking to build complex agent systems or applications requiring stateful, iterative processing, LangGraph provides a robust foundation that can significantly reduce development time and improve system quality. However, those working on simpler applications should carefully evaluate whether the additional complexity is justified by their specific requirements and use cases.\\n\\n[Langgraph](/tag/langgraph?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Llm](/tag/llm?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Llm Applications](/tag/llm-applications?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[AI](/tag/ai?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Pipeline](/tag/pipeline?source=post_page-----a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[## Written by Ken Lin](/@ken_lin?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n[41 followers](/@ken_lin/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\n·[23 following](/@ken_lin/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--a51d5eb68d03---------------------------------------)\\n\\nI'm Ken, an engineer specializing in AI and machine learning.

2024\\n\\n   9  min read\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field. As a result, language models have advanced to a point where AI agents are able to perform complex tasks and make complex decisions. However, as these agents’ skills have grown, the infrastructure that supports them has found it difficult to keep up. Presenting LangGraph, a revolutionary library that aims to revolutionize AI agent building and runtime execution.\\n\\n#### **Overview**\\n\\n* LangGraph is a library built on top of Langchain that is designed to facilitate the creation of cyclic graphs for large language model (LLM) – based AI agents.\\n* It views agent Objective Points about LangGraph and workflows as cyclic graph topologies, allowing for more variable and nuanced agent behaviors than linear execution models.\\n* LangGraph uses key elements such as nodes (representing functions or Langchain runnable items), edges (defining execution and data flow), and stateful graphs (managing persistent data across execution cycles).\\n* The library supports multi-agent coordination, allowing each agent to have its prompt, LLM, tools, and custom code within a single graph structure.\\n* Langgraph introduces a chat agent executor that represents the agent state as a list of messages, which is particularly useful for newer, chat-based models.\\n\\n## Table of contents\\n\\n* [Introduction](#h-introduction)\\n* [The Pre-LangGraph Era](#h-the-pre-langgraph-era)\\n* [What is LangGraph?](#h-what-is-langgraph)\\n* [Why use LangGraph?](#h-why-use-langgraph)\\n* [How LangGraph Works?](#h-how-langgraph-works)\\n* [Tool Calling in LangGraph](#h-tool-calling-in-langgraph)\\n  + [Pre-requisites](#h-pre-requisites)\\n  + [Define Tools](#h-define-tools)\\n* [Pre-built Agent](#h-pre-built-agent)\\n* [Build an Agent](#h-build-an-agent)\\n* [What LangGraph Offers?](#h-what-langgraph-offers)\\n* [Real-World Example of LangGraph](#h-real-world-example-of-langgraph)\\n* [The Future of AI Agents](#h-the-future-of-ai-agents)\\n* [Conclusion](#h-conclusion)\\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](#h-frequently-asked-questions)\\n\\n## The Pre-LangGraph Era\\n\\nThe agent executor class in the [Langchain framework](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/10/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-chains-in-langchain/) was the main tool for building and executing AI agents before LangGraph. This class relied on a straightforward but powerful idea: it used an agent in a loop, asking it to make decisions, carry them out, and log observations. This technique had its uses, but its adaptability and customization possibilities were intrinsically restricted.\\n\\nAlthough functional, the agent executor class limited developers’ ability to design more dynamic and flexible agent runtimes by imposing a particular pattern of tool calling and error handling. As AI agents became more sophisticated, the need for a more adaptable architecture emerged.\\n\\n## What is LangGraph?\\n\\nIn response to these constraints, LangGraph presents a novel paradigm for agent building and runtime construction. [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/03/an-introduction-to-large-language-models-llms/) are the foundation for designing sophisticated AI agents, and LangGraph, built on top of Langchain, is intended to make the process of creating cyclic graphs easier.\\n\\nLangGraph views agent workflows as cyclic graph topologies at their foundation. This method enables more variable and nuanced behaviors from agents, surpassing its predecessors’ linear execution model. Using graph theory, LangGraph provides new avenues for developing intricate, networked agent systems.\\n\\n## Why use LangGraph?\\n\\n* **Flexibility:** As AI agents evolved, developers required more control over the agent runtime to enable personalized action plans and decision-making procedures.\\n* **The Cyclical Nature of AI Reasoning:** Many intricate LLM applications depend on cyclical execution when employing strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning. LangGraph offers a natural framework for modeling these cyclical processes.\\n* **Multi-Agent Systems:** As multi-agent workflows became more common, there was an increasing demand for a system that could efficiently manage and coordinate several autonomous agents.\\n\\n**State Management:** As agents became more sophisticated, tracking and updating state data as the agent was being executed became necessary. LangGraph’s stateful graph methodology satisfies this need.\\n\\n## How LangGraph Works?\\n\\nThe functionality of LangGraph is based on several essential elements:\\n\\n* **Nodes:** These are functions or [Langchain](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/10/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-chains-in-langchain/) runnable items, like the agent’s tools.\\n* **Edges:** Paths that define the direction of execution and data flow within the agent system, connecting nodes.\\n* **Stateful Graphs:** LangGraph allows for persistent data across execution cycles by managing and updating state objects as data flows through the nodes.\\n\\nThe following diagram can be used to illustrate the working:\\n\\nAs shown in the image, the nodes include LLM, tools, etc. which are represented by circles or rhombus which. Flow of information between various nodes is represented by arrows.\\n\\nThe popular [NetworkX library](https://networkx.org/) served as the model for the library’s interface, which makes it user-friendly for developers with prior experience with graph-based programming.\\n\\nLangGraph’s approach to agent runtime differs significantly from that of its forerunners. Instead of a basic loop, it enables the construction of intricate, networked systems of nodes and edges. With this structure, developers can design more complex decision-making procedures and action sequences.\\n\\nNow, let us build an agent using LangGraph to understand them better. First, we will implement tool calling, then using a pre-built agent, and then building an agent ourselves in LangGraph.\\n\\n## Tool Calling in LangGraph\\n\\n### Pre-requisites\\n\\nCreate an OpenAI API key to access the LLMs and Weather API key ([get here](https://www.weatherapi.com/)) to access the weather information. Store these keys in a ‘.env’ file:\\n\\n**Load and Import the keys as follows**:\\n\\n```\\nimport os from dotenv import load_dotenv load_dotenv(\\'/.env\\') WEATHER_API_KEY = os.environ[\\'WEATHER_API_KEY\\']\\xa0 # Import the required libraries and methods import json import requests import rich from typing import List, Literal from IPython.display import Image, display from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults from langchain_core.tools import tool from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n```\\n\\n### Define Tools\\n\\nWe will define two tools. One is to to get weather information when the query is specific to weather and another is to search the internet when the LLM doesn’t know the answer to the given query:\\n\\n```\\n@tool def get_weather(query: str) -> list: \"\"\"Search weatherapi to get the current weather.\"\"\" base_url = \"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json\" complete_url = f\"{base_url}?key={WEATHER_API_KEY}&q={query}\" response = requests.get(complete_url) data = response.json() if data.get(\"location\"): \\xa0 \\xa0 return data else: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 return \"Weather Data Not Found\" @tool def search_web(query: str) -> list: \"\"\"Search the web for a query.\"\"\" tavily_search = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2, search_depth=\\'advanced\\', max_tokens=1000) results = tavily_search.invoke(query) return results\\n```\\n\\nTo make these tools available for the LLM, we can bind these tools to the LLM as follows:\\n\\n```\\ngpt = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0) tools = [search_web, get_weather] gpt_with_tools = gpt.bind_tools(tools)\\n```\\n\\nNow, let’s invoke the LLM to with a prompt to see the results:\\n\\n```\\nprompt = \"\"\" \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Given only the tools at your disposal, mention tool calls for the following tasks: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do not change the query given for any search tasks \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 1. What is the current weather in Greenland today \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 2. Can you tell me about Greenland and its capital \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 3. Why is the sky blue? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"\"\" results = gpt_with_tools.invoke(prompt) results.tool_calls\\n```\\n\\n**The results will be the following:**\\n\\nAs we see, when we ask about the weather, get\\\\_weather tool is called.\\n\\nThe GPT model doesn’t know the who won ICC worldcup in 2024, as it is updated with information upto October 2023 only. So, when we ask about this query, it is calling search\\\\_web tool.\\n\\n## Pre-built Agent\\n\\nLangGraph has pre-built react (reason and act) agent. Let’s see how it works:\\n\\n```\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent # system prompt is used to inform the tools available to when to use each system_prompt = \"\"\"Act as a helpful assistant. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use the tools at your disposal to perform tasks as needed. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - get_weather: whenever user asks get the weather of a place. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 - search_web: whenever user asks for information on current events or if you don\\'t know the answer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use the tools only if you don\\'t know the answer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \"\"\" # we can initialize the agent using the gpt model, tools, and system prompt. agent = create_react_agent(model=gpt, tools=tools, state_modifier=system_prompt) # We will discuss its working in the next section. Let’s query the agent to see the result. def print_stream(stream): for s in stream: \\xa0\\xa0 message = s[\"messages\"][-1] \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 if isinstance(message, tuple): \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 print(message) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 else: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 message.pretty_print() inputs = {\"messages\": [(\"user\", \"who won the ICC worldcup in 2024?\")]} print_stream(agent.stream(inputs, stream_mode=\"values\"))\\n```\\n\\nAs we can see from the output, the LLM called the search\\\\_web tool for the given query, and tool found a URL and returned content back to the LLM which contains result to the query. Then, LLM returned the answer.\\n\\n## Build an Agent\\n\\nNow we build an agent using langGraph:\\n\\n```\\n# import the required methods from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END # define a tool_node with the available tools tools = [search_web, get_weather] tool_node = ToolNode(tools) # define functions to call the LLM or the tools def call_model(state: MessagesState): messages = state[\"messages\"] response = gpt_with_tools.invoke(messages) return {\"messages\": [response]} def call_tools(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"tools\", END]: messages = state[\"messages\"] last_message = messages[-1] if last_message.tool_calls: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 return \"tools\" return END\\n```\\n\\nThe call\\\\_model function takes “messages” from state as input. The “messages” can include query, prompt, or content form the tools. It returns the response.\\n\\nThe call\\\\_tools function also takes state messages as input. If the last message contains tool calls, as we have seen in tool\\\\_calling output, then it returns “tools” node. Otherwise it ends.\\n\\nNow let’s build nodes and edges:\\n\\n```\\n# initialize the workflow from StateGraph workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState) # add a node named ‘LLM’, with call_model function. This node uses an LLM to make decisions based on the input given workflow.add_node(\"LLM\", call_model) # Our workflow starts with the ‘LLM’ node workflow.add_edge(START, \"LLM\") # Add a ‘tools’ node workflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node) # depending on the output of the LLM, it can go ‘tools’ node or end. So, we add a conditional edge from LLM to call_tools function workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"LLM\", call_tools) # ‘tools’ node sends the information back to the LLM workflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \"LLM\")\\n```\\n\\nNow let’s compile the workflow and display it.\\n\\n```\\nagent = workflow.compile() display(Image(agent.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\n```\\n\\nAs shown in the image, we start with the LLM. The LLM either calls the tools or ends based on the available information to it. If it calls any tool, the tool executes and send the result back to the LLM. And the LLM again decides to call the tool or end.\\n\\nNow let’s query the agent and see the result:\\n\\n```\\nfor chunk in agent.stream( {\"messages\": [(\"user\", \"Will it rain in Bengaluru today?\")]}, stream_mode=\"values\",): chunk[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n```\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\nAs we have asked about the weather, get\\\\_weather tool is called and it returned various weather related values. Based on those values, the LLM returned that it is unlikely to rain.\\n\\nIn this way, we can add different kinds of tools to the LLM so that we can get our queries answered even if LLM alone can’t answer. Thus LLM agents will be far more useful in many scanarios.\\n\\n## What LangGraph Offers?\\n\\nLangGraph offers a powerful toolset for building complex AI systems. It provides a framework for creating [agentic systems](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/building-agentic-rag-systems-with-langgraph/) that can reason, make decisions, and interact with multiple data sources. Key features include:\\n\\n* **Modifiable Agent Runtimes:** With LangGraph, developers may create runtimes specifically suited to particular use cases and agent behaviors, overcoming the limitations of the conventional agent executor.\\n* **Support for Cyclic Execution:** When cyclic graphs are enabled, LangGraph makes applying sophisticated reasoning methods that require several LLM iterations easier.\\n* **Improved State Management:** Because LangGraph graphs are stateful, more intricate agent state tracking and updating can be done throughout the execution phase.\\n* **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Within a single graph structure, each agent can have its prompt, LLM, tools, and custom code. LangGraph is an expert in building and administering these kinds of systems.\\n* **Flexible Tool Integration:** LangGraph’s node-based structure allows agents to easily incorporate various tools and functionalities into their repertoire.\\n* **Better Control Flow:** LangGraph’s edge-based approach provides fine-grained control over the execution flow of an agent or multi-agent system.\\n* **Chat-Based Agent Support:** LangGraph introduces a chat agent executor, representing the agent state as a list of messages. This is particularly useful for newer chat-based models that handle function calling as part of message parameters.\\n\\n## Real-World Example of LangGraph\\n\\nLangGraph has many different real-world applications. It makes more complex decision-making processes possible in single-agent contexts by letting actors review and improve their arguments before acting. This is especially helpful in difficult problem-solving situations where linear execution might not be sufficient.\\n\\nLangGraph excels in multi-agent systems. It permits the development of complicated agent ecosystems, wherein many specialized agents can work together to accomplish intricate tasks. LangGraph controls each agent’s interactions and information sharing through its graph structure, which can be developed with specific capabilities.\\n\\nFor instance, a system with distinct agents for comprehending the initial query, retrieving knowledge, generating responses, and ensuring quality assurance may be developed in a customer service setting. LangGraph would oversee information flow management, enabling smooth and efficient consumer engagement among these workers.\\n\\n## The Future of AI Agents\\n\\nFrameworks such as LangGraph are becoming increasingly important as AI develops.

It may be difficult to coordinate these agents, keep context across steps and achieve reliable results. LangGraph is a tool for solving this challenge. It is a framework on LangChain ecosystem that gives a way to define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents in complex workflows. In other words, for anyone wondering what is LangGraph, it is a stateful orchestration framework for AI agents that gives developers more control over how those agents interact and solve problems.\\n\\nLangChain launched LangGraph in 2023 as an addition to its toolkit, and it has rapidly become popular among AI developers. In June 2024, LangGraph achieved a stable release and almost 50 percent of the organizations that used LangChain LangSmith observability tool were using LangGraph in their applications. In this article, I will decompose the main ideas of LangGraph, discuss its applications with examples, and tell you how to start working with this powerful framework.\\n\\n## **LangGraph at a Glance**\\n\\nLangGraph is an open-source library from the LangChain team and free to use. It can be used in [Python](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-python-programming/ \"Python\") as well as JavaScript environments, which means that it can be used by a large number of developers. In contrast to more basic chain-based systems, LangGraph is a graph-based system that coordinates AI workflows. This means that instead of a linear sequence of steps, an application is modeled as a directed graph of nodes and edges.\\n\\nThe graph is composed of nodes (representing a unit of work, e.g. an LLM call or a tool invocation) and edges that characterize the flow of information and control between the units. LangGraph allows more complex, multi-agent interactions and decision-making processes than linear pipelines by modelling workflows as graphs (with the option of loops or cyclical flows). State management is automatically done by the framework across the graph and all agents get the context they require as the workflow continues. To put it briefly, LangGraph is about coordinating various AI elements to operate in coordination, have memory of previous interactions, and enable complex control flows within an application.\\n\\n**Is LangGraph free and open source?** Yes. [LangGraph is released under the MIT open-source license and is free to use for any project](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph#:~:text=Is%20LangGraph%20open%20source%3F%20Is,it%20free). The core LangGraph library can be self-hosted and integrated into your own infrastructure without cost. For production deployments, the LangChain team also offers *LangGraph Platform* as a managed service (with additional features like a hosted server, developer studio, and scaling options), but using the LangGraph open-source framework itself does not require any subscription. This makes LangGraph an attractive option for developers and companies who want full control over their AI agent workflows without vendor lock-in.\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| **`FURTHER READING:`** |\\n| `1. 15 Best Mobile App Development Platforms to Review in 2025` |\\n| `2. 10 Mobile App Development Tips You Need to Know` |\\n| `3. Top 10 Mobile App Development Software in 2025: A Review` |\\n\\n## **Key Concepts of LangGraph**\\n\\nLangGraph proposes some main concepts that make it different to the simpler orchestration tools. These concepts are important to understand what does LangGraph do internally and how does it make advanced AI applications possible. The fundamental ideas are graph structure, state management, and agent coordination, and additional features (persistent and human interaction). These concepts are summarized below:\\n\\n### **Graph Structure**\\n\\nLangGraph represents an AI application as a directed graph. The graph nodes are discrete units of work or computation, usually Python functions that do something like call an LLM, query a database, call a tool or API, or implement business logic. Edges are the links between nodes which define the flow of execution. An edge may be a straight path or a conditional branch that sends the workflow in one direction or another depending on the result of a node (like an if-else decision).\\n\\nThis graph-based method introduces clarity and modularity: each node performs a certain sub-task, and the edges determine the way the system moves between steps. LangGraph allows cycles (loops) in the graph, and thus supports iterative processes, where an agent may repeat steps as required, which is not easy to achieve in a strictly linear chain-based system. This graph structure therefore forms the skeleton of the construction of complex and non-linear workflows.\\n\\n### **State Management**\\n\\nIn multi-step AI processes, it is essential to be able to track information (memory) between steps. LangGraph has automatic state management to preserve and pass context across the graph. The state is a common object (such as a dictionary or Pydantic model) that nodes may read and write to during the execution of the program.\\n\\nAn example is in a [chatbot](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-a-chatbot-and-how-does-it-work/ \"chatbot\") application whose state could be used to save the history of the conversation so that the AI could remember what was said previously. The state may contain intermediate results or user preferences in a data analysis agent. LangGraph keeps this state dynamic as agents go about their work. Since the state is centrally managed, any agent (node) can always access the most up-to-date context that it requires to perform its task. This aspect takes the pressure off the developers to explicitly pass context around or deal with global variables. Rather, LangGraph provides consistency and continuity of data which is vital in ensuring coherence in complex conversations or multi-step calculations. One of the most impressive features of LangGraph is automatic state management which makes development easier and error-free by managing the context behind the scenes.\\n\\n### **Agent Coordination and Control Flow**\\n\\nLangGraph is simply about the coordination of multiple agents (or chain components) to work towards a goal. It makes sure that the agents act in the right sequence, under the appropriate conditions and with the required information shared among them.\\n\\nThis coordination implies that you can have specialized agents, e.g. one agent to plan a task, another agent to retrieve information, another agent to produce a final answer, all within one coordinated system. LangGraph allows such advanced control flow constructs as loops (cycles) and conditional branches, allowing agents to make decisions and even re-attempt or re-edit steps when necessary. LangGraph enables high-level logic development by developers without concern over low-level scheduling of agent actions by controlling the flow of execution. It is in a sense the project manager of your AI agents, ensuring that each piece of the workflow occurs when it should and there is relay of the correct data to the next step. This results in more deterministic and debuggable behavior than allowing an LLM agent to run in a runaway loop. The outcome is sound, organized orchestration of AI work.\\n\\n### **Multi-Agent Support**\\n\\nLangGraph is particularly suitable to support multi-agent systems due to its graph design and statefulness. In a multi-agent system, various AI agents perform different subtasks (e.g. one agent may be specialized in knowledge retrieval whereas another agent is specialized in reasoning or decision-making). LangGraph gives the support structure to these agents to communicate and collaborate. The agents may be modeled as nodes, and the graph edges and shared state determine their interactions.\\n\\nSuch a modular design has advantages such as specialization (each agent can be configured or triggered to perform its particular task) and simplified troubleshooting (you can identify which node/agent may be causing a problem). LangGraph can help create multi-agent workflows to address complex problems in which the work is broken down and then the results are combined by the orchestrator. As an example, a multi-agent research assistant could be designed with one agent retrieving relevant documents, another agent processing the content to find answers, and a third agent generating a coherent report, all running in a single LangGraph workflow.\\n\\n### **Persistence and Debugging**\\n\\nLangGraph has a persistence layer through checkpointers that is able to save the state of the graph at different points. This makes possible such powerful features as time travel (replaying or exploring alternative execution paths) and fault tolerance (resuming at a checkpoint in case something goes wrong). Further, LangGraph allows breakpoints to halt execution, and even a human-in-the-loop, where a human can step in at specific steps.\\n\\nThese properties are essential to debugging complex agent behavior, and to applications where human confirmation is required (e.g. an AI agent may wait until a human confirms an answer before continuing). Another feature is streaming support- LangGraph supports streaming token-by-token outputs of LLMs to offer real-time feedback within user interfaces. All these complex features render LangGraph as production ready where robustness and user experience are priorities. They also point out the attention that the framework pays to providing the developers with visibility and control over the thought process of the agent, rather than treating the agent as a black box.\\n\\nTo conclude, the main ideas of LangGraph are based on the management of complexity with the help of a graph model. Graph structures provide flexibility in workflow design; state management makes sure that context is maintained; coordination and control flow tools enable complex logic and multi-agent systems; and built-in capabilities such as persistence, streaming, and human-in-loop support make it feasible in real-world, error-tolerant systems. It is this set of features that has led to LangGraph being referred to as adding a degree of control to agent workflows over previous agent frameworks.\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| **`FURTHER READING:`** |\\n| `1. 10 Web Application Examples and Definition for Beginners` |\\n| `2. Web Application Development Tutorial: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners` |\\n| `3. Web Application Security: The Best Guide and Its Practices` |\\n\\n## **Common Use Cases of LangGraph**\\n\\nLangGraph is a general framework, but it truly shines in scenarios where simple linear chains are not enough. Here are some concrete examples and use cases of LangGraph in action:\\n\\n### **Advanced Customer Service Chatbots**\\n\\nLangGraph is used by companies to create smart customer support chatbots that are not limited to Q&A. As an example, a chatbot with LangGraph can remember previous orders or preferences of a user stored in the shared state and utilize that information to personalize a response. It can deal with multi-step requests (such as checking an order status, followed by making a return), and can even escalate to a human agent when required at a breakpoint. This enhances customer service by delivering faster, context-sensitive responses and human-in-the-loop handoff to handle more complex problems.\\n\\n### **Research Assistant Agents**\\n\\nLangGraph is able to organize agents as a research assistant to analysts or students. One agent may search the scholarly articles or data sources, another one may extract and summarize the main points of the sources, and the third agent may create a report or provide answers to the questions. This type of system is able to automatically collect information and bring out key insights on large sets of documents. The graph workflow makes sure that the search and summarize steps occur sequentially and that the summary agent receives all the information it requires. The use case shows that LangGraph can control retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in a systematic manner.\\n\\n### **Personalized Learning Systems**\\n\\nLangGraph can drive tutoring or e-learning assistants that can be customized to the learner in the field of education technology. As an example, an intelligent tutor may employ one agent to evaluate the performance of a student on practice questions, and another agent to create new exercises or explanations depending on the weak areas of the student. The state would monitor the progress and preferences of the learner. LangGraph enables such a system to adapt the content dynamically- in effect a customized curriculum planner and tutor in one. The advantage is a personalized learning process in which the AI keeps track of what the student has not grasped and returns to review the same.\\n\\n### **Business Process Automation**\\n\\nCompanies are using LangGraph to automate and simplify their internal processes. As an example, take an agent that would review incoming documents (forms, invoices, etc) to approve them: one node would use an LLM to extract key information about the document, another would check it against a database, and a final agent would make the decision to approve or flag the document to be reviewed by a human. In the same way, project management activities or data analysis can be shared among several agents (one gathers data, another interprets it, another makes a report). With LangGraph, these processes are turned into automated pipelines capable of accommodating decision points and exceptions.\\n\\nAn example is a LangGraph workflow that automates a multi-step process of generating a report that once involved a number of human handoffs. The outcome is enhanced productivity and minimization of human error because the routine tasks are taken care of by the coordinated agents.\\n\\n### **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning Tasks**\\n\\nWhenever an AI solution requires *reasoning through a series of steps* (tool use, calculations, intermediate conclusions), LangGraph is a strong fit. Developers have used LangGraph to build systems like coding assistants (where the agent writes code, tests it, debugs, and tries again in a loop), data pipelines that require cleaning data then applying multiple AI models in sequence, or decision-support systems that weigh different factors via separate agents. The graph approach handles these branching or looping workflows gracefully, whereas a simple chain might fail if a step needs to be revisited or if parallel paths need to converge.\\n\\nThese examples illustrate that LangGraph’s use cases typically involve interactive and intelligent AI agents working in concert. From customer support to research, education, and enterprise automation, LangGraph enables AI solutions that are context-aware, can handle multiple subtasks, and can incorporate logic beyond a single prompt-response. Notably, the rise of such agentic workflows is reflected in industry trends – by late 2024, [43% of organizations using LangSmith (LangChain’s monitoring suite) were sending LangGraph traces](https://blog.langchain.com/langchain-state-of-ai-2024/#:~:text=As%20companies%20are%20getting%20more,go%20beyond%20basic%20LLM%20interactions), indicating a significant uptick in complex multi-step AI applications. This suggests that teams across various domains find value in LangGraph to build more reliable and controllable AI systems than what was possible with earlier one-shot or single-agent approaches.\\n\\n## **Getting Started with LangGraph**\\n\\nNow that we have covered *what LangGraph is* and why it’s useful, let’s look at **how to get started** with LangGraph. Despite enabling complex functionality, LangGraph is designed to be developer-friendly. Here are the basic steps to start building with LangGraph:\\n\\n### **1. Installation**\\n\\nYou can install LangGraph via pip, as it is available on PyPI. Run the following command in your Python environment to get the latest version:\\n\\n*pip install -U langgraph*\\n\\nThis will install the LangGraph library (and its LangChain dependencies if not already present). LangGraph has both Python and JavaScript SDKs, so if you are working in a [Node.js](https://www.designveloper.com/blog/what-is-node-js/ \"Node.js\") environment, you can install the JavaScript package via npm or yarn as well.\\n\\n### **2. Define the Graph and State**\\n\\nThe core of a LangGraph application is the **StateGraph**. You start by defining what the *state* will contain. For example, if building a chatbot, your state might include a list of messages. In Python, you can define a TypedDict or dataclass for the state. Then you create a StateGraph object using that state structure. This sets up an empty graph where each future node will automatically have access to an instance of that state. For instance:\\n\\n*from langgraph.graph import StateGraph*\\n\\n*class State(TypedDict):*\\n\\n*messages: list\\xa0 # to store conversation history*\\n\\n*graph = StateGraph(State)*\\n\\nHere, we’ve defined a state with a single field messages which will hold a conversation log. The StateGraph(State) creates a new graph that knows this is the shape of its state.\\n\\n### **3. Add Nodes (Agents) to the Graph**\\n\\nNext, you’ll add **nodes** to the graph. Each node is essentially a function (or an object with a run method) that performs a part of the task. You might have a node that calls an LLM, another node that calls a calculation tool, etc. Using our chatbot example, you could have one node that takes the user’s input and sends it to an LLM to get a response. You define a Python function for that behavior, then use graph.add\\\\_node(name, function) to add it to the graph. For example:\\n\\n*def chatbot\\\\_reply(state: State) -> dict:*\\n\\n*user\\\\_message = state[“messages”][-1]\\xa0 # last message from user*\\n\\n*response = llm.call(user\\\\_message) \\xa0 \\xa0 # call an LLM (pseudo-code)*\\n\\n*return {“messages”: [response]} \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 # append LLM response to messages*\\n\\n*graph.add\\\\_node(“reply”, chatbot\\\\_reply)*\\n\\nIn this snippet, “reply” is the node name. The function chatbot\\\\_reply reads the latest user message from state and returns a new message from the LLM. LangGraph will handle merging that return value into the global state (using special helpers like add\\\\_messages to append rather than overwrite, in this case). You can add as many nodes as needed, each encapsulating a piece of your logic.\\n\\n### **4. Connect Nodes with Edges**\\n\\nAfter defining nodes, you specify how they connect. An edge from Node A to Node B means that after A executes, B will execute next. If multiple edges branch out, you can create conditional execution paths (for example, an edge that only triggers if Node A’s result meets some criteria). In a simple flow, you might have a single path. In our chatbot, if we only have one node “reply” that should repeat on each user input, we can set the graph’s entry point and finish point to that node (creating a cycle):\\n\\n*graph.set\\\\_entry\\\\_point(“reply”)*\\n\\n*graph.set\\\\_finish\\\\_point(“reply”)*\\n\\nThis configuration indicates the graph starts at the “reply” node and also ends there, which effectively forms a loop: after finishing, it can start again when new input arrives. For more complex workflows, you would use graph.add\\\\_edge(node1, node2) for explicit transitions. For instance, you could connect a “plan” node to a “search” node to a “summarize” node in a research assistant scenario. The directed edges ensure the LangGraph orchestrator knows the sequence (or branching logic) to follow.\\n\\n### **5. Compile and Run the Graph**\\n\\nOnce nodes and edges are defined, you typically compile the graph into a runnable form. In LangGraph, calling compiled\\\\_graph = graph.compile() will prepare the graph (check for any issues, lock in the structure). You can then execute it by passing an initial state and letting it run. Using the chatbot example, you might run it in a loop:\\n\\n*compiled\\\\_graph = graph.compile()*\\n\\n*while True:*\\n\\n*user\\\\_input = input(“User: “)*\\n\\n*if user\\\\_input in [“quit”, “exit”]:*\\n\\n*break*\\n\\n*# Start the graph with the new user message added to state*\\n\\n*initial\\\\_state = {“messages”: [(“user”, user\\\\_input)]}*\\n\\n*for event in compiled\\\\_graph.stream(initial\\\\_state):*\\n\\n*# stream yields events as the LLM generates tokens*\\n\\n*pass*\\n\\n*# After streaming, the state will have the assistant’s answer appended*\\n\\n*answer = compiled\\\\_graph.state[“messages”][-1][1]\\xa0 # assuming tuple (speaker, text)*\\n\\n*print(“Assistant:”, answer)*\\n\\nThe above pseudocode outlines how you might continuously take user input and feed it to the LangGraph for processing. The stream() function is used to get token-by-token output (so that the assistant’s answer can be displayed incrementally). After the graph finishes a cycle, the latest assistant message is retrieved from the state for display. This loop would continue until the user decides to quit.\\n\\nFor non-interactive workflows, you might simply call result = compiled\\\\_graph.run(initial\\\\_state) to get a final output after the sequence of nodes executes. The LangGraph documentation and tutorials provide examples of both synchronous execution and streaming.\\n\\n### **6. Leverage Advanced Features**\\n\\nAs you become comfortable, you can utilize LangGraph’s advanced capabilities. For example, you can insert breakpoints or conditional logic that halts the agent and awaits human confirmation (useful in high-stakes applications like medical or financial domains). You can also persist the state to a database at checkpoints so that long-running processes can resume after interruptions. [LangGraph Studio, an IDE announced in 2024](https://blog.langchain.com/langgraph-studio-the-first-agent-ide/#:~:text=LangGraph%20Studio%20facilitates%20this%20by,at%20that%20point%20in%20time), allows you to visually debug and monitor your graph’s execution on your local machine. These tools can greatly enhance the development experience for complex graphs, but they build on the same fundamentals described above.\\n\\n### **7. Resources and Tutorials**\\n\\nGetting started with LangGraph is best done with guided examples. The official LangChain documentation provides a Quick Start guide and conceptual docs. There are also community tutorials available. For instance, DataCamp offers a *LangGraph tutorial* that walks through building a simple chatbot step by step. Analytics Vidhya has a free LangGraph tutorial for beginners that includes hands-on examples like a support chatbot with tools and memory. (Note: Some people refer to it as a *Langraph tutorial* without the capital “G”, but it’s the same LangGraph framework.) These learning resources illustrate LangGraph examples in code, helping new users quickly pick up the concepts. By following a tutorial and experimenting with a small project, you can gain a practical understanding of LangGraph’s workflow approach in a few hours.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nThis guide explained what is langgraph and why teams use it for agentic workflows.

      "LangGraph is an open-source library from the LangChain team and free to use. It can be used in Python as well as JavaScript environments, which means that it can be used by a large number of developers. In contrast to more basic chain-based systems, LangGraph is a graph-based system that coordinates AI workflows. This means that instead of a linear sequence of steps, an application is modeled as a directed graph of nodes and edges. [...] Imagine creating an AI application in which several language model agents collaborate on a complex task. It may be difficult to coordinate these agents, keep context across steps and achieve reliable results. LangGraph is a tool for solving this challenge. It is a framework on LangChain ecosystem that gives a way to define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents in complex workflows. In other words, for anyone wondering what is LangGraph, it is a stateful [...] workflow continues. To put it briefly, LangGraph is about coordinating various AI elements to operate in coordination, have memory of previous interactions, and enable complex control flows within an application.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Technical Accuracy:\n",
    "- Inlcude specific version numbers\n",
    "- Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks\n",
    "- Cite official documentation\n",
    "- Use technical terminology precisely\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Length and Style:\n",
    "- Strict 150-200 word limit\n",
    "- No marketing language\n",
    "- Technical focus\n",
    "- Write in simple, clear language do not use complex words unnecessarily\n",
    "- Start with your most important insight in **bold**\n",
    "- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Structure:\n",
    "- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)\n",
    "- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:\n",
    "    * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)\n",
    "    * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:\n",
    "        - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists\n",
    "        - Use `1.` for ordered lists\n",
    "        - Ensure proper indentation and spacing\n",
    "- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:\n",
    "    * List each source with title, date, and URL\n",
    "    * Format:`- Title : URL`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Writing Approach:\n",
    "- Include at least one specific example or case study if available\n",
    "- Use concrete details over general statements\n",
    "- Make every word count\n",
    "- No preamble prior to creating the section content\n",
    "- Focus on your single most important point\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use this source material obtained from web searches to help write the section:\n",
    "{context}\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Quality Checks:\n",
    "- Format should be Markdown\n",
    "- Exactly 150-200 words (excluding title and sources)\n",
    "- Careful use of only ONE structural element (table or bullet list) and only if it helps clarify your point\n",
    "- One specific example / case study if available\n",
    "- Starts with bold insight\n",
    "- No preamble prior to creating the section content\n",
    "- Sources cited at end\n",
    "- If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,\n",
    "  ensure they are escaped properly for correct rendering e.g $25.5 should become \\$25.5\n",

    "- Write in simple and clear language\n",
    "- Focus on the core motivation for the report in 1-2 paragraphs\n",
    "- Use a clear narrative arc to introduce the report\n",
    "- Include NO structural elements (no lists or tables)\n",
    "- No sources section needed\n",
    "\n",
    "For Conclusion/Summary:\n",
    "- use ## for section title (Markdown format)\n",
    "- 100-150 word limit\n",
    "- For comparative reports:\n",
    "    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax\n",
    "    * Table should distill insights from the report\n",
    "    * Keep table entries clear and concise\n",
    "- For non-comparative reports:\n",
    "    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report\n",
    "    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)\n",
    "    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:\n",
    "        - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists\n",
    "        - Use `1.` for ordered lists\n",
    "        - Ensure proper indentation and spacing\n",
    "- End with specific next steps or implications\n",
    "- No sources section needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Writing Approach:\n",
    "- Use concrete details over general statements\n",
    "- Make every word count\n",
    "- Focus on your single most important point\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quality Checks:\n",
    "- For introduction: 50-100 word limit, # for report title, no structural elements, no sources section\n",
    "- For conclusion: 100-150 word limit, ## for section title, only ONE structural at most, no sources section\n",
    "- Markdown format\n",
    "- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response\n",
    "- If there are special characters in the text, such as the dollar symbol,\n",
